// the mirror on the left has receptor number 0 every p distance
// the mirror on the right has receptor number 0 at every 2np distance and receptor 1 at every (2n+1)p distance
// a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance q from the 0th receptor.
// Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.
